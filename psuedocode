Sophia Python Project - Yahtzee Pseudocode
By Pat Schwanfelder

Author's Note #1: It is assumed that the reader knows the rules of Yahtzee. Please refer
to the following webpage for rules and common terms for the game:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee#Rules

Author's Note #2: The author refers to the "Upper section" as the "Lower hand", and
the "Lower section" as the "Upper hand" due to house rules when growing up.

Start program:
	Prompt user for number of players
	Prompt user for each player's name
	Record number of players total

	Create a scorecard for each player
	Scorecard must contain the following spaces:
		A lower hand section for scoring ones through sixes
		An upper hand section with the special rolls:
			3/4/5 of a kind, full house, small/large straights, etc.
		A method to calculate its total score
		A method to see if a spot has been played previously to prevent a player from overwriting a previous score

	Loop through 13 iterations of the following (there are 13 categories and players cannot skip a category. Hard coding 13 loops makes sense)
		Each player takes a turn and does the following:
			Roll 5 dice to make a "hand"
			Ask the user which dice in the hand they want to keep (these won't be changed)
			The remaining dice will be rolled again
			Repeat this process up to two times (for a total of three rolls)

		Ask the player where they want to take thier points
			Get user input to determine the category the player wants
			Determine how many points the user is awarded for that category

		Repeat for the next player
		Repeat until each card has been filled

	Look at all the scorecards to see who has the highest total
	Declare the highest value to be the winner.
